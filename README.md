# Face-Detection-OpenCV

## Introduction

I have written a code in python which is used to detect faces using bounding rectangles. We can detect as much as many faces we want at a time. I have used MediaPipe package along with cv2. 

### Here is the screenshot of an image in which my face has been detected in real time. 
In this image, my face captured in the mobile has also been detected.
